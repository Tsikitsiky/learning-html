          To write a good HTML document, there are rules that you have to follow.
        </p>
        These are some of them:
        <ul>
          <li>You cannot have an end tag without a start tag</li>
          <li>Every start tag must start with a greater than symbole and end with a less than symbole</li>
          <li>Every end tag must start with a greater than symbole followed by a / and end with a less than symbole</li>
          <li>Use lower case for the best of your code</li>
          <li><a href="nesting-rules.html">The nesting rules</a></li>
